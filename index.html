<p>Salary for dash core team</p>

<h3>
<a id="overview" class="anchor" href="#overview" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Overview</h3>

<p>While v12 enabled budgeting and removed the reference node, our donation system was rendered inoperable by the latest version. The donation feature was supporting many of our developers, so we would like to replace that income stream with a more permanent solution that does not rely on altruism.</p>

<p>Working on Dash should come with some incentive, like receiving some money from the blockchain every month. However, we don't want to micromanage an open source project and we feel we have a highly trustworthy team. The way we plan on using the core team budget is to simply split it between all team members.</p>

<h3>
<a id="scope" class="anchor" href="#scope" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Scope</h3>

<p><strong>Human Resource Management</strong></p>

<p>To be a paid team member, one simply needs to agree to our pledge. The pledge is To work on Dash each and every day to expand and improve the ecosystem to the best of my ability?. Whatever someone feels they can contribute to the project is fine, as long as they meet that minimum amount of work. </p>

<p>Our team structure is highly organized. We have professional project managers onboard which are helping monitor and optimize our process. These project managers have pledged to act as objective observers, hold each team member accountable for what they say they will do, and will recommend if some team members are underperforming or for other reasons need to be removed from a paid spot on the team.</p>

<p><strong>Scope of services</strong></p>

<p>Anyone, with any skill set (software, quality assurance, automation, admin, marketing, legal, etc) is needed. </p>

<h3>
<a id="schedule" class="anchor" href="#schedule" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Schedule</h3>

<p>It's up to the person how much they work on Dash and how much they are able to earn from the project.  Some of us will work really hard on Dash (often for 10+ hours a day), because we believe in it and we're willing to put in the time to make Dash a critical part of the future economy. We believe it's worth the time to do this.  Others have full time jobs, but they like to contribute during mornings, nights, and weekends. This is all great, the more people we can get putting effort into the project the better off we'll be in the long run.</p>

<p><strong>Fund Allocation Transparency</strong></p>

<p>We will be 100% transparent about who on our team is paid and how much they are paid. As defined, a core team member is someone that has made the above pledge to work on Dash everyday. That person then has the freedom to work on Dash as much as they wish to expand their earning potential. We believe in transparency when it comes to the administration of a decentralized product such as Dash, so we will make this data available on one of the websites for the community.</p>

<p><strong>Compensation Methodology</strong></p>

<p>I'd like to stress that this compensation is by no means meant to provide a "full-time salary" for contributors. Compensation will be modest. At current market prices, the compensation would fall in the category of token appreciation.  We intend to have 2 kinds of slots for paid team members depending on the amount of time they are willing to commit - part-time and full-time. Full-time slots will offer payment of 2-4x (TBD by the project management team, maybe even a monthly contest?) that of a part-time slot. Team members can switch between the two depending on how much they feel they can offer to the project. This should give us flexibility to provide incentive for development and show appreciation for the work that is being done.  We will also encourage team members to hold their Dash they are paid long term. </p>

<p>We believe in this project and want all those getting compensated to benefit when we finally succeed, this will help spread the benefit out to those that contribute the most to make it happen.  Having lots of people involved with Dash is what makes this successful! If you want to contribute, feel free to ping any of us to join the team.</p>
